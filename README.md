What's being covered? (white paper links included below)
- Day 1: [Foundational Models](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-foundational-llm-and-text-generation) & [Prompt Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering) - Explore the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning, inference acceleration, and reasoning models. Get trained with the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

- Day 2: [Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-embeddings-and-vector-stores) - Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoffs.

- Day 3: Generative AI [Agents](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-agents) and [Agent Companion](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-agent-companion)- Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process, including recent agentspace development.

- Day 4: [Domain-Specific LLMs](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-solving-domains-specific-problems-using-llms) - Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

- Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI - Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.

Capstone Project goes live: 
On the final day of the event, April 4th, 2025, we will launch the capstone project, giving you the opportunity to apply the knowledge you've gained throughout the course. By participating in the capstone project, you will earn both a badge and a certificate on Kaggle.
- Capstone project goes public and live: End of Day 5 on Fri Apr 4
- Submission deadline: Sun Apr 20 at 23:59 PT

Award:
All participants will have a chance to receive [a badge on their Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/536046). This badge will also come with a certificate that can be downloaded and shared on social media or added to resumes.
